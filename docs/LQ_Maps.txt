LibreQuake Map List:
Include the level name, author, and what weapons the level will give the player. Put an asterisk by the weapon to denote that it's a secret item.
Feel free to include requests for earlier and later maps in the episode, such as if you want your level to have the first appearance of a weapon.
If you don't know where the level will fit into the episode yet, put it in the "Unsorted Singleplayer Levels" section.
See the bottom for the guidelines we have set for how the campaign will work.

Theming:
The second map for Episode 2 would be a sort of base installation in a jungle with some small temples nearby where they are basically doing excavations on the site. You then would enter a larger temple and thats where the aztec theme becomes more central. As you get deeper and deeper into the temples, the place starts to become more and more organic, with meat covering walls, teeth doors, and weird nasty organ stuff BUT not full on meat level. Still is recognizable as an aztec map. The last map would basically be where you fight the worm boss inside a meat level (which is supossed to be Tlaltecuhtli, which is basically an earth monster that was used as a basis for the world and has to be feed blood so it doesnt fuck shit up from what I remember)

Episode 4's levels all take place underground. (Except for the second level and secret level.) They all end with the player jumping into a pit to the next level.

Every Map Must Have:
A music track
A name
Four cooperative spawns
Deathmatch support

    -These maps are designed for singleplayer, so they probably won't play very well in Deathmatch. But at least try to make it work as well as you can.

    -Consider using func_walls to make passages that only exist in Deathmatch to give the level more connectivity. See e3m1 in the original game for an example of this. Or add in some new teleporters.

    -You can also block off certain areas so they can't be accessed in Deathmatch. For performance reasons (and because of domination mode), you should set all entities in that area to not appear in Deathmatch.

    -Consider the items that are available to players. Remember that you can set weapons to only appear in DM. Here are some ranges to go for with item availability:

    0 to 2 Rocket Launcher

    0 to 2 Lightning Gun

    1 to 2 Grenade Launcher

    1 to 2 Super Shotgun

    1 to 2 Super Nailgun

    0 to 2 Nailgun

    0 to 1 Quad Damage

    0 to 1 Pentagram

    0 to 1 Ring of Shadows

    0 to 2 Biosuit

    0 to 1 Red Armor

    1 to 2 Yellow Armor

    2 to 4 Green Armor

    1 to 3 Megahealth

    2 to 4 Small Rocket Pack

    3 to 5 Small Cell Pack

    Plenty of 15 and 25 health

    Plenty of Shells and Nails
